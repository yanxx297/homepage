More accurate emulator testing by running it under a symbolic executor.
<!--more-->

------
As a successor project of Fast PokeEMU, we would like to run QEMU under
FuzzBALL, our symbolic executor, and compare the outcoming symbolic
expressions with those of other DBT systems.

Currently we would like to compare QEMU with Bochs.
Other candidates are Valgrind and HQEMU.
